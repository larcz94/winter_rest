        <p style="padding:55px 69px 30px 39px;" >Winter occupies a beautiful, grand 100 year colonial home at the bottom of Gregory’s Road in Colombo 7, the heart of the city’s residential and diplomatic district. With culinary flair, Winter’s chefs have been interpreting traditional Italian cuisine to the delight of all .

You could dine on the verandah overlooking the beautiful garden and impressive marquee; the latter is the perfect place for a stylish dinner party. You can dine upstairs in one of our Private dining rooms, the perfect place to host special lunches or dinners or choose the scenic balcony on the first floor . 

Alternatively, our menu is an ode to all that is delicious and wonderful about Italian food, and is the pride of The Bayleaf’s Executive Chef, Saroj, who has over 20 years of experience working in international chains of Italian restaurants.

Worth looking out for are the exciting Special Promotions, which we feature alongside Harpo’s Pizza of the Month.<br/>

 <p style="padding: 0 43px 1px 36px;" >Winter is open from 11:00 am until midnight on weekdays and 1:00 am on Fridays and Saturdays. We are flexible when it comes to last orders, but these tend to be at around 11:00 pm and midnight respectively. 

Either before or after your meal, you can visit our Retro Bar – a delightful cross between a bar and a lounge – for a cocktail or two, where you can enjoy great music played on the video wall in a convivial, informal atmosphere. It is without doubt “the friendliest bar in town”.

Winter provides a complete catering service - be it a boardroom breakfast or lunch, kiddies’ party or an elegant evening with your friends – we can help you with menus and a complete service from start to finish. </p>
